# ttyT1941
Simple demonstrator to show how to control a Tacx motor brake via a serial connection.

TACX sells the T1941 motor brake in a bundle called _FORTIUS T1940 Virtual Reality Trainer_ together with the T1942 'solid blue' head unit and some software. With this little tool you can control the T1941 without the T1942 head unit and without additional software.

# Warning

The whole project is experimental. It worked for my personal setup. There is absolutely no warranty, that this works with your brake or with your USB2TTL adapter.

Building your own USB2TTL adapter or using the software **may destroy your motor brake, your adapter or even your PC**.

It is **HIGHLY** recommend to use 3.3V TTL logic, because the brake may not be 5V tolerant!

The protocol itself was not analyzed by me. It depends on work from Michel Dagenais and code written for Golden Cheetah
