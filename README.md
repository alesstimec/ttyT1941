# tty1942
Simple demonstrator to show how to control a Tacx T1941 motor brake via a serial connection.

======================  
**A warning first:**  
======================  

The whole project is experimental. It worked for my personal setup. There is absolutely no warranty, that this works with your brake or with your USB2TTL adapter.

Building your own USB2TTL adapter or using the software may destroy your motor brake, your adapter or even your PC.

======================  
**It is HIGHLY recommend to use 3.3V TTL logic, because the brake may not be 5V tolerant**  
======================

The protocol itself was not analyzed by me. It depends on work from Michel Dagenais and code written for Golden Cheetah
